Introduction to Visual Programming with TouchDesigner

In this 2-day workshop media artist Stefan Kraus will introduce participants to the powerful visual development platform and present best practices for its use it in media installations, video projections and live performances.

The course will introduce artists, performers and designers to the mutilmedia authoring environment TouchDesigner. TD is a node based visual programming language, that was specifically designed to enable artists to create interactive programs without having to write a single line of code. This allows users to experiment with cutting edge technology, prototype interaction and explore the possibilities of digital creation.

The course combines a general introduction to node based programming with hands-on exercises and provides extensive examples to pick apart at home.
